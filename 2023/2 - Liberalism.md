# Liberalism

# Michael Goheen, MTC

# Western Faith: Confessional Humanism

Autonomous man is capable of defining the world and humanity’s chief end \(Creator\) and solving problems of world and bring about a new world \(Redeemer\) with his own \[especially rational\] resources\.

# Enlightenment Faith: Peak of humanism

* Faith in progress toward better world \(freedom\, equality\, prosperity\, happiness\, justice\, peace\)
* Accomplished by reason disciplined by method \(science\)
* Science\-based technology controls non\-human creation
* Scientific control of laws of society enables the formation of a rational society \(politics\, economics\, education\, etc\.\)
  * <span style="color:#FF0000">Liberalism</span>  provides basic vision for society based on a false analogy with physics that “reduces society to its component parts and attempts to reconstruct it on a more rational basis\. ”

# Liberalism as component of Enlightenment humanism

Central component of Enlightenment worldview is  <span style="color:#FF0000"> _liberalism_ </span>

Constructing society around  <span style="color:#FF0000"> _freedom of the individual_ </span>

Freedom=Autonomy: Self\-directed individual\, no authority outside of sovereign individual\, one chooses course of one’s life; governed by rational self\-interest – what makes me happy is inviolable norm

Society organized on basis of rights and autonomous freedom of the individual

In Europe revolutions established new social order on this basis against backdrop of suppressed freedom in older social hierarchies of feudalism

US founded in midst of Enlightenment as the “land of the free”

Canada founded when this was foregone conclusion

Brasil? Globalisation and ??

# Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens (1789)

Liberty consists of being able to do anything that does not harm others: thus\, the exercise of the natural rights of every man or woman has no bounds other than those that guarantee other members of society the enjoyment of these same rights\. \(Article 4\)

# Contemporary example from Supreme Court

US Supreme Court’s decision in  _Planned Parenthood vs\. Casey_  \(1992\): “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence\, of meaning\, of the universe\, and of the mystery of human life\.”

# French Revolution and Liberalism

The revolutionaries held one set of assumptions: human beings are endowed with certain inalienable rights\, including the freedom to govern themselves as they see fit\. Social and political life should consist of whatever free individuals make of those areas of life\. The guiding principle is the promotion of each person’s freedom and autonomy\. That set of assumptions\, as we know\, has become the basic framework for thought and action in the modern world\. Even Christians tend to accept that view of social and political life\. J\. Skillen

# Chief end of human life

What is the chief end of human life?

Liberalism: To have the freedom to pursue the good according to my own rational self\-interest

Liberal society: Society that organizes its political\, economic\, educational\, judicial\, social life on the basis of the autonomous individual

# Ten Components of Modern Liberalism

_Equality: _ All human beings are created equal

_Liberty: _ All human beings are created to freely pursue own good

_Individualism:_  Society is made up of a collection of individuals; priority of individuals to social institutions

_Universal humanity_ : All human beings are the same

_Tolerance: _ Liberal societies foster tolerance for the freedom of each individual to choose

_Rule of law_ : Need for good judicial system \(politicians\, police\, courts\) to uphold freedoms and protect property

_Institutions_  \(political\, legal\, economic\, educational\) are based on reason and therefore good

_Scientific objectivity: _ Scientific method used in social sciences creates neutral and good institutions and society

_Human rights_  are at basis of liberal society and to be protected

_Meritocracy: _ Since all people are equal and free\, merit will determine one’s wealth\, power\, situation

# Stages of Economic Liberalism

Classical liberalism: Totally  <span style="color:#FF0000">free market</span>

Regulatory liberalism: Government begins to regulate some of the injustices of free market

Social democracy: Government becomes more involved beyond regulation in actual initiative and ownership \(FDR and New Deal\)

Neoliberalism: Return to privatisation and deregulation \(Reagan\, Thatcher\)

Growing critiques leading to return to some kind of social democracy

# Initial observations

* Individual freedom always produces:
  * <span style="color:#FF0000">Injustice</span>  because some are stronger\, smarter\, privileged\, etc\. – not born equal\!
  * Recognition of  <span style="color:#FF0000">communal</span>  dimensions of society including acting for common good
  * Only option on offer to correct these? Marxist or neomarxist or socialistic or communistic humanism

# Four stages of development of (political) liberalism

Political liberalism: The responsibility of government is to protect rights and freedoms of individual

Classical liberalism of Enlightenment

Regulatory liberalism

Equal opportunity liberalism

Choice enhancement liberalism

And perhaps a fifth? Totalitarian liberalism

# What will we see as we trace development?

Development is driven by contradictions of liberal idolatry

Constant  _faith commitment_  to freedom of the individual as the  _ultimate good_  and basis for just and prosperous world

All American visions of life are liberal whether they be right or left \[progressive – moderate – conservative liberalism\]

Various political ideologies of right and left are just poised at different places in the story

Central dilemma in political liberalism: Role of government in protecting or enhancing individual freedom leads from small to big government

Idolatry fails to deliver on promises and suppresses other creational realities; its contradictions lead to negative outcomes\, conflict\, injustice\, and reactions

# 1. Enlightenment Liberalism

Liberalism arose in the 17th c\. century

Shaped Enlightenment vision

Right of individual to pursue own self\-interest

Modeled on science\, society reduced to smallest component part – individual – and then rationally reconstructed

Role of government is to protect the rights\, freedoms\, and property of individual

Liberalism wed to growing commitment to economic growth

Government is limited to protect the free market and \(especially\) the rational  _economic_  self\-interest of each individual

# Government and early liberalism

Government is a  _threat _ to individual freedom

_ _ Must be limited to protecting freedom of each person to pursue economic self\-interest and freedom of the market

_ _ Economic life: Like a game with built\-in rules to be observed \[capitalism\]

Government is a referee that enforces the rules \(law and order\) to protect the integrity of the game but not to determine the outcome – determined by merit  \(meritocracy\)

# Two ways of understanding freedom historically

Look back: Rights and freedoms are enshrined in the bill of rights as inherent to humanity and society; need is to defend these rights against whatever threatens them \[‘protological’\]

Look ahead: Continual process and endless struggle to acquire more and more freedom that is threatened by oppression \[‘eschatological’\]

# Crisis of Faith in Industrial Revolution

* Contradictions: Freedom produces injustice\, oppression\, and inequality that destroys freedom
* Crisis of faith for Enlightenment progress and liberalism
* Two answers:
  * <span style="color:#FF0000">Marx</span> : Freedom allows strong to construct unjust structures; freedom and equality will come in overturning unjust structures
  * <span style="color:#FF0000">Liberals</span> : Economic game has winners and losers just like evolution \(“survival of the fittest”\); government must continue to referee\, enforce rules of capitalism

# 2. Regulatory liberalism

Social Darwinism morally repugnant and couldn’t be defended

So government must either: 1\) regulate big business \(curtail their freedom to protect freedom of rest\); and/or 2\) break up monopolies; 3\) protect victims by law?

17th\-19th c\. classical liberalism: Government is  _threat_  to freedom

20th c\. regulatory liberalism: Government  _protects_  freedom – interventionist

Commitment to freedom requires slightly larger role for government against powerful groups inhibit freedom

# 3. Equal opportunity liberalism

Classical liberalism: Government leaves space for individuals to pursue self\-interest equally

Yet there is hardly equality\!

Government is referee to enforce rules of game; but there is an unlevel playing field; some have tremendous advantage; unfair and unequal

Must be equality of opportunity for true freedom

Rise of the welfare state: Government must intervene more to secure this true freedom

Either  _safety net_  \(e\.g\.\, disabled\, elderly\) or  _level playing field _ \(e\.g\.\, affirmative action\)

# Idolatry of freedom …

Leads to injustice that subverts equality and freedom

Which leads to self\-correcting process that tries to address injustices and protect freedom

Which leads to the growth of government to manage\, protect\, enhance\, promote true freedom and equality {::comment}idolatry of freedom, leads produces injustices always {:/comment}

{::comment}
idolatry of freedom, leads produces injustices always
{:/comment}

# 4. Choice enhancement liberalism

Liberalism denies there is any good or chief end for human life and society

Must be rationally determined by each individual

Consumer society:  _Proliferation_  of many desires and pursuits of chief end

“Spiritually vacant” state: Referee who protects all freedoms and lifestyles; accommodate all desires

# Problems and contradictions

* “Freedoms” have undesirable consequences \[covenant nature of creation\] for everyone
  * Freedom to own guns produces murder\, mass violence
  * Sexual freedom produces unwanted pregnancies\, STDs
  * Freedom of easy divorce produces single mothers and children raised without fathers often in poverty
* Government may not legislate; only referee – protect all freedoms and counteract consequences
* Role of government expands – real question becomes whether or not it can really be a neutral referee\!

* Growing conflict between freedoms
* People asked to set aside deep convictions about what is just and good
  * Same\-sex marriage or gender transitioning: Compels those who believe it is detrimental to people and society to be quiet
  * Gender: Don’t believe your eyes \(e\.g\.\, transgender athletes\)
  * Abortion: Child in womb is just fetal tissues
* Government must now step in and adjudicate: not neutral but take sides – all in the name of protecting freedom for all

# Which liberalism?

We’re all liberals\!

Conflict and contradictions drive  _“conservative liberals” _ to return to an earlier stage of liberalism when freedom was about rights and market

Conflict drives  _“progressive liberals” _ to interpret this as a march for more and more freedom against injustices and oppression of growing number of minorities whose freedoms and rights are threatened

Attaches itself to certain neo\-Marxian elements

Problem: The very commitment to autonomous freedom must  _inevitably_  take this path

# Fifth stage?

Is the next stage an omnicompetent state that will suppress liberty in the name of protecting liberty?

Growing conflict between growing freedoms requires resolution

But according to what vision of the good?

Claim no vision of good but must adjudicate conflict

Totalitarian government that simply assumes  _their_  vision of the good and imposes it?

Tyranny that imposes their ideological vision?

# Creational insight and idolatrous distortion

What is true\, good and creational in liberalism?

What is true\, good and creational in “conservative liberalism”?

What is true\, good\, and creational in “progressive liberalism”?

How have they all be distorted and become oppressive by the idolatry of the free and autonomous individual? And by economic idolatry?

# Christian vocation at this time

God’s world\, God’s mission\, God says: “I’ve got this\!”

Our task is a faithful witness in life\, word\, and deed

Lament for injustice  _and_  thanksgiving for order\, justice\, good we still do see

Define biblical social justice over against social justice of left or right

Reject ideological loyalty

Enhance creational good wherever it is found – will be strategic or  _ad hoc _ and particular to our gifts\, callings\, opportunities

Mercy and compassion for victims of all idolatry

Embody in our own lives another view of freedom

Christian social philosophy – principled pluralism

# True freedom

Gal 5\.13\-15; Jn 8\.31\-38 ; 1 Cor 10\.23\-24; Rom 7\.17\-18; 1 Pet 2\.16

Liberal culture built on freedom defined as rational  _self\-interest_

God’s kingdom built on freedom defined as Spirit\-empowered  _self\-giving_  for the sake of the other

Liberal culture built on freedom as  _autonomous_

God’s kingdom built on freedom that is a  _slave to God_  – you’re a slave to whatever you serve
